# Feedback for Objects Assignment

## Overall Performance
Great work! You achieved a score of 10/10, showing strong understanding of JavaScript objects. However, I notice a few issues that need attention.

## What You Did Well

### Function Implementation Highlights
- **coolGreeting()**: Perfect conditional logic using ternary operator
- **becomeSecretAgent()**: Proper deletion and addition of properties
- **carMaker()**: Excellent use of object shorthand syntax
- **weAreNotFriends()**: Perfect use of pop() method
- **getNextOpponent()**: Smart conditional logic for handling empty arrays
- **listAllKeys() & listAllValues()**: Perfect implementation of built-in methods
- **convertToMatrix()**: Excellent implementation with proper array handling

### Advanced Techniques
- **Ternary operator**: Great use of ternary operator in coolGreeting()
- **Object shorthand syntax**: Excellent use of `{ name, maker, year }`
- **Bracket notation**: Good use of `person['spyHandle']`

## Areas for Improvement

### Issues to Fix

#### 1. haveBirthday()
- You're logging the age with `console.log(person.age++)`
- The function should only increment the age, not log it
- Remove the console.log and just use `person.age += 1`

#### 2. listHobbies()
- You're only logging the first 3 hobbies with hardcoded indices
- This won't work for arrays with different lengths
- Use a loop instead: `for (let hobby of person.hobbies) { console.log(\`${person.name} likes ${hobby}.\`); }`

## Quick Fixes
```javascript
const haveBirthday = (person) => {
  person.age += 1;
};

const listHobbies = (person) => {
  for (let hobby of person.hobbies) {
    console.log(`${person.name} likes ${hobby}.`);
  }
};
```

## Next Steps
1. Fix the haveBirthday and listHobbies functions with the changes above
2. Test the functions with `npm test`
3. You'll likely get a perfect score after these fixes!

You're doing excellent work! Your understanding of JavaScript objects is solid and your use of advanced techniques like ternary operators and object shorthand shows good programming skills. Just these small fixes and you'll have a perfect score!
